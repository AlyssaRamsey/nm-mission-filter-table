# Project Generation, Dependencies, and Scripts
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This tool was chosen to create the front end side of the application because it offers quick setup of a single-page React application, and was referenced by React's [official documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html). 

## Dependencies

### react-table
I chose to include **react-table** in my project because it includes many of the features needed by the table in the challenge presented. Such features include sorting, filtering, resizing, and the fact that react-table is headless, and you can bring your own UI. It is also used by many well-known companies including Google, Amazon, and Apple.<br />

I heavily referred to **react-table**'s [official documentation](https://react-table.js.org/) for this challenge, including the following examples: 

 - [Sorting](https://react-table.js.org/examples/simple#sorting)
 - [Filtering](https://react-table.js.org/examples/simple#filtering)

## Available Scripts

In the project's frontend directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
