# Project Generation, Dependencies, and Scripts
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This tool was chosen to create the front end side of the application because it offers quick setup of a single-page React application, and was referenced by React's [official documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html). 

## Available Scripts

In the project's frontend directory, you can run:
### `npm install`
Install all necessary dependencies for the project. This must be ran before running `npm start`.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Dependencies

### react-table
I chose to include **react-table** in my project because it includes many of the features needed by the table in the challenge presented. Such features include sorting, filtering, resizing, and the fact that react-table is headless, and you can bring your own UI. It is also used by many well-known companies including Google, Amazon, and Apple.<br />

I heavily referred to **react-table**'s [official documentation](https://react-table.js.org/) for this challenge, including the following examples: 

 - [Sorting](https://react-table.js.org/examples/simple#sorting)
 - [Filtering](https://react-table.js.org/examples/simple#filtering)
