# Northwestern Mutual MISSION/CHALLENGE

Create a responsive (phone, tablet, desktop) web application that allows the user to quick filter a list of things. The top of the page will have a search input field and then below that a list of things in response to the filter. The things should be sorted alphabetically. The things could be anything, but should be AJAX pulled from a backend service that you write and should ultimately be pulled from an open public API.

Here&#39;s an example list of API&#39;s curated on GitHub, [https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) but feel free to use any public API you wish.

# Code Notes
For more detailed information on why I used certain libraries, please refer to the the README's under the Frontend and Backend folders.

## Quickstart
`npm install` should be ran under ***both*** the backend and frontend directories in order to install necessary dependencies. `npm start` should then be ran under ***both*** the Backend and Frontend directories. You can view the project at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
