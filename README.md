# Northwestern Mutual MISSION/CHALLENGE

Create a responsive (phone, tablet, desktop) web application that allows the user to quick filter a list of things. The top of the page will have a search input field and then below that a list of things in response to the filter. The things should be sorted alphabetically. The things could be anything, but should be AJAX pulled from a backend service that you write and should ultimately be pulled from an open public API.

Here&#39;s an example list of API&#39;s curated on GitHub, [https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) but feel free to use any public API you wish.
